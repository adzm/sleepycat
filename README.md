just a simple win32 app with a cute icon, personally used a test bed template for a variety of win32 experiments

this does implement a systray icon in a way that avoids the bug (still exists in windows 10) where notification area icons become blurrier and blurrier each time the dpi changes (eg if you are closing the laptop screen and only using the external monitor which has a different dpi and then back). somewhere in explorer it is repeatedly scaling the image.
